#Semafor

Semafor (read as Semaphore) is a new GNOME program for testing the knowledge of driving regulations
in Serbia.

The program is currently in early alpha. The program requires data and assets released from the
Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs under the terms which deny commercial usage. Because I do not
know what the equivalent CC license for that is, I am not releasing those assets on which
Semafor depends for running (data.db) until I figure out correct licensing terms for both data and
the code.

TL;DR: Don't clone this repo because the program currently can't be run. Yet.
